# Churn Prediction Model

## Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn using a machine learning model built with XGBoost. The dataset used for training and testing is the Churn_Modelling dataset.

## Project Structure

- `churn_model.py`: Script for training the churn prediction model and saving it using pickle.
- `app.py`: Streamlit app for uploading data, preprocessing, and making predictions using the trained model.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Churn_Modelling.csv** file, which contains customer information and labels indicating whether a customer has churned.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/churn-prediction.git
    cd churn-prediction
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure you have the dataset file (`Churn_Modelling.csv`) in the appropriate directory.

## Usage

1. Train the model and save it using the `churn_model.py` script:
    ```bash
    python churn_model.py
    ```

2. Run the Streamlit app to make predictions:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

3. Upload the dataset through the Streamlit interface and see the results including the confusion matrix, accuracy score, and training accuracy.

## Results

### Confusion Matrix
The confusion matrix generated by the model will be displayed here.

### Accuracy
The accuracy score achieved by the model will be shown here.
